    <h1>The Era of Space Exploration</h1>
    
    <hr>

    <p>
        Space exploration is the use of astronomy and space technology to explore outer space. 
        One of the most famous events was the Apollo 11 mission. 
        It was a <strong>monumental achievement</strong> for humanity. </p>

    <h2>1. The Early Days</h2>
    
    <p>
        Before humans went to space, animals were sent to test the safety of space travel. 
        The first animal to orbit the Earth was a dog named <em>Laika</em>. Unfortunately, technology was not advanced enough to bring her back safely.

    <h3>2. The Moon Landing</h3>
    
    <p>
        Neil Armstrong was the first person to walk on the moon.<br>
        He famously said, "That's one small step for man, one giant leap for mankind."
    </p>

    <h4>3. Modern Space Travel</h4>
    <p>
        Today, we have the International Space Station (ISS) orbiting the Earth.
        <mark>Mars is the next big target</mark> for human exploration. </p>
